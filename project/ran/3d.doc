IMPORTENT NOTE:
---------------
this program was written as a 3d-graphic generator.
the 3d-generator is intended to be used as the main 3d-project.
this pre-version is a limited version of the project.

SO - SORRY FOR THE INCONVINIANCE BUT WE DIDN'T IMPLEMNTED (YET) HELP SCREEN.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

keys to move the helicopter:
----------------------------
'd' - down nose of the helicopter.
'u' - up nose of the helicopter.
'+' - zoom in.
'-' - zoom out.
'/' - tilt left.
'*' - tilt right.
'8' - up.                  -+
'2' - down.                 | num lock arrow keyes.
'4' - left.                 |
'6' - right.               -+

'q' - quit.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

files & contents:
-----------------
main.c 		- main program for the exercise.
int_math.c (.h) - integer mathematical library.
3d_util.c (.h)	- specific & general graphic functions.
intrprtr.c (.h) - main interpreter/executer for the program.
util.c (.h)	- general utility & memory allocation utility.
types.def	- definition of types for the project.

film.dat	- film file for the helicopter.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

the program & the film file shows the basic 3D operations with matrixes
& hirarcial graphic tree.

all the mathematical calculations is done with integer values !!.
(it's about 4 times faster then F.P. - we mesured on benchmark program).

the main program is a "command interpreter" that reads an input file in
our graphic language,crates the polygons,element & film data structure &
then run the film commands.
the language we implemented gives us the ability to rotate/move/zoom elements
anywere on the graphic tree & to interact with event keyes.


language to build 3d structures:
--------------------------------
declerations of polygons:

   #p poly_name  (x,y,z),
		 (x,y,z),
		 .
		 .
		 .
   #p poly_name  (x,y,z),
		 (x,y,z),
		 .
		 .
		 .
   .
   .
   .

each triplet is a 3D cordinate.


declerations of elements & the associated polygons:

   #e e_path	deg_x,deg_y,deg_z,off_x,off_y,off_z,zoom
      poly_name	color
      poly_name color
      .
      .
      .

   #e e_path	deg_x,deg_y,deg_z,off_x,off_y,off_z,zoom
      poly_name	color
      poly_name color
      .
      .
      .

the "deg_x,deg_y,deg_z,off_x,off_y,off_z,zoom" are the initial parameters to
rotate , move & zoom - i.e: we build an eqvivalent matrix for it.


labguage of the film:
---------------------
each film shows the syntax we used (it's not final !!).

delay delay		- delay the film operation for "delay" miliseconds.
end			- initiated end of film.
goto label		- skip to "label" in the film.
label label		- declare "label" in the film.
attrib e_path attrib	- operate attrib on te element.
event key label		- skip to "label" after key is pressed.
var var_name value	- create "var_name" variable with value.
add var_name value	- add value to "var_name".
jzero var_name label	- branch to "label" if "var_name"<1.
showall			- update screen & flip pages.


the graphic data structure:
---------------------------
the graphic data structure is basically a tree. each element is linked with
his sons & parent in a way that creates a tree. each element can have
un-limited number of sons & polygon associated with it.

the tree module:
----------------
regular tree:			our tree:

	     +---+			   +---+
	     |   |			   |   |
	     |   |			   |   |
	     +---+			   +---+
	     ||  |			     |
	     ||..|			     |
       +-----+|  +---+		       +-----+
       |      |      |		       |
      \|/    \|/    \|/		      \|/
     +---+  +---+  +---+	     +---+  +---+  +---+
     |   |  |   |..|   |	     |   |->|   |->|   |
     |   |  |   |  |   |             |   |  |   |..|   |
     +---+  +---+  +---+	     +---+  +---+  +---+
      ...    ...    ...		      ...    ...    ...


each element in the tree is linked to other elemente in the same depth & son
element in lower depth.

each element has a diffrent link to a linked list of polygons to be drawed
for that element.

polygons:
---------
polygons are linked with linked list for the interpreter conviniant.


		typical connection of polygons to element.

thats about it.
